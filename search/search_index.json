This book is written with one simple goal: to ensure you, as a brother, never fail in your most important duty\u2014serving, respecting, and, above all, obeying your sister(s). I love my sisters, and Iam completely writing this under no pressure of any kind. No not my face</p>"},{"location":"#chapter_1_the_universal_law_of_yes","title":"Chapter 1: The Universal Law of \"Yes\"","text":"<p>A good brother does not say \"no\" to his sister. It\u2019s not just a rule\u2014it\u2019s the foundation of a peaceful life. If she asks you to drive her and her friends somewhere, the correct answer is \"Of course!\" If she requests your last piece of chocolate, the only response is, \"I wasn\u2019t even hungry!\" Any deviation from this principle will result in eternal suffering, endless guilt trips, and possibly public humiliation.  </p> <p>Remember: The word \u201cno\u201d is an illusion. It doesn\u2019t exist in a brother\u2019s vocabulary.  </p>"},{"location":"#chapter_2_your_sisters_cooking_is_the_best_food_youve_ever_had","title":"Chapter 2: Your Sister\u2019s Cooking is the Best Food You\u2019ve Ever Had","text":"<p>It doesn\u2019t matter if her pasta is slightly overcooked, undercooked, not cooked at all or resembles a cement mix; you will eat her food with enthusiasm. You will not only eat it, but you will also praise it as if they were prepared by a Michelin-starred chef.  </p> <p>Example Correct Response: \"Wow, this is the best thing I\u2019ve ever eaten. You should open a restaurant!\" </p> <p>Example Incorrect Response: \"Is this...burnt?\" If you ever utter the incorrect response, prepare for starvation, as you may never be fed again.  </p>"},{"location":"#chapter_3_the_art_of_selective_listening","title":"Chapter 3: The Art of Selective Listening","text":"<p>A good brother knows when to listen and when to nod while pretending to listen. Mastering this skill ensures survival. When your sister is telling a long story about some celebrities or what happened with her friend\u2019s cousin\u2019s dog\u2019s groomer, your role is to nod, add an occasional \u201cwow,\u201d and always agree with her conclusion.  </p> <p>Pro Tip: If she asks, \u201cWere you even listening?\u201d always reply, \u201cOf course! That\u2019s crazy, I can\u2019t believe that happened!\u201d It works 99% of the time.  </p>"},{"location":"#chapter_4_the_unwritten_rules_of_sharing","title":"Chapter 4: The Unwritten Rules of Sharing","text":"<ul> <li>If she borrows your stuff, it\u2019s called \"sharing.\"  </li> <li>If you borrow her stuff, it\u2019s called \"stealing.\"  </li> <li>If you complain, you\u2019re \"being dramatic.\"  </li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s best to accept your fate and allow her unrestricted access to your belongings.
